Just my (relatively complete) solutions for Yorgey's excellent
[CIS194](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/fall14/spring13/lectures.html)
course.

In the `fall14` directory you will also find some of my work on the
Fall 2014 version of the course. I basically switched to the Fall 2014
version halfway through the Spring course, expecting them to be
relatively similar. After finishing up I went back and looked at the
Spring '13 course and realized I had never really learned about
Applicatives, so I went back and brushed up on some things.
