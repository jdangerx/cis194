Just me working through Yorgey's excellent [CIS194](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/lectures.html) course.

I have not been particularly organized in taking this course. 
Weeks 1-5 are from the [Spring 2014](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/fall14/lectures.html) course.
Weeks 6-14 are from the [Fall 2014](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/fall14/spring13/lectures.html) course.
